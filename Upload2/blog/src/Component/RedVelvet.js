<h3 >Instructions:</h3>
<div className="par">

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. You can use an electric mixer or do it by hand with a wooden spoon.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and red food coloring. Mix well.

Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk mixture. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing just until combined after each addition. Do not overmix.

In a small bowl, combine the white vinegar and baking soda. It will fizz. Add this mixture to the cake batter and stir until well combined.

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

Once the cakes have cooled completely, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of cream cheese frosting on top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the entire cake with the remaining cream cheese frosting.
